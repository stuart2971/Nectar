        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">About</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">All types of radish are very fool-proof.  Anyone can grow a radish to full maturity!  If you are a beginner or are looking for something easy to grow, most types of radish is for you and can even grow to full maturity in as little as 4 weeks.  <br><br>Your relationship with your radish is simple.  Give it lots of water and it will love you!  Radishes weirdly like A LOT of water. And I mean A LOT.  Sometimes when I am watering my radishes, I think that I’mgoing to drown them, but the next day, they are better than ever!<br><br>I suspect this is because radishes are native China’s wetlands and often grew near rice fields.  Therefore in other parts of the world, excess water is better for these plants.<br></p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">How to Plant</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">When first growing out your radishes, the germination process is very quick and easy, it can take only about 5-7 days. I grow my radishes from seeds that you can find at any plant or garden store.  Heck! they even sell the seeds at a dollar store!  You can also chop off the end of the a radish you have bought from the store or grown in your garden.  <br><br>After chopping off the heads of the radishes, stick them in the ground and they should start growing right away! Keep in mind this is different for all radishes.  For example, Daikon radishes prefer the weather to be a little colder in order to germinate, so these tips and tricks may only be effective on sparkler white tip radishes. <br><br>Personally, I use seeds that you can buy in the store.  There are 2 ways I have germinated them and the best way I found was just simply placing into the ground.  I tried the moist paper towel method to germinate the seeds, but I found that they did not grow as strong as the ones I have planted directly into the ground.  Also, transplanting the sprouted seeds from the paper towel to the ground can be risky.  You might risk snapping the stems.  <br><br>So if planting them right into the ground is more effective, then why even use the paper towel method?  The reason for that depends on what you choose to do.  For me, the reason why I plant them right into the ground is because it is just easier that way.  Some may germinate them separately first, because you can use special nutrients and vitamins in order to speed up the germination process.  This step is totally up to you!</p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Watering<br></strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">After you see the plant spout out from the ground, you can then start to water it frequently.  Where I live, our summers can go up to 35°C meaning watering may be necessary every day.  For the most part, I watered my radish every day, because that it what I had to do for where I live.  I suggest that if you live in really hot weather, try to put your radish where it is partially shady to avoid having to water it so often.<br></p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Environment<br></strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">Just because they like a lot of water don’t think that you can get away with putting it in full shade.  These plants still need a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.  Only partial shade is recommended. <br><br>Also, depending on where you live, the pungency levels of your radish may be increased or decreased.  If you live in a really hot area, the smell of the radish will be much stronger than growing it in a cooler climate.  <br><br>What happens if you do not water you radish enough?  Try it, I dare you.  Just kidding, not much happens.  It is mainly just the texture that changes.  Too little water may result in a woodiness texture and excessive pungency.  If that’s what you like, go for it!<br></p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Storing<br></strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">After a few weeks, your radishes should be ready to harvest and eaten! Radishes can actually be stored for quite a while.  If you are planning to store them for several weeks, do not wash the dirt off until you are ready to eat it.<br><br>Try to keep your radish in a cool, dry place, to avoid molding.  The radish leaves can be kept in an air tight baggie or container to preserve the freshness.  Pickling the radish is another option for storage can be stored even longer when pickled.<br></p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Soil<br></strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">Radish can pretty much grow in all types of soil, though, rough and compacted soils is not reccommended, as it may either slow down the maturing stage or make your bulbs very small.  <br><br>I suggest using light, friable loam soil. Make sure it contains humus too.  Of course, this is a bit extra and is optional, but for best growth, this soil mixture is by far the best I have used.   Also, make sure you do not have too much nitrogen in the soil, because that makes the roots smaller and leaves bigger.<br></p><img src="../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.52.12-AM.png" loading="lazy" width="667" srcset="../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.52.12-AM.png 500w, ../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.52.12-AM.png 800w, ../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.52.12-AM.png 1080w, ../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.52.12-AM.png 1274w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 667px" alt=""></div>
