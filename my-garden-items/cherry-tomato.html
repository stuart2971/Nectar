        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">About</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">Oh boy are cherry tomatoes hard to grow!  Comparing to some other vegetables, cherry tomatoes are very needy and need a lot of attention.  When growing cherry tomatoes, I think it is better to grow them in pots, where you can monitors them more frequently to maintain a healthy moisture level and amount of sunlight and shade.<br></p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Want to Grow Them?</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">Let&#x27;s start from the beginning.  How I grew my tomatoes was by cutting an already harvested seeded one in half and placing them (inside up) some light soil.  This, to me, is the easiest way to grow a cherry tomato.  This will speed up the germination process.  Personally, I don’t like to separately germinate the seeds.  Instead, I just place that entire half tomato in soil.</p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">How to Take Care of Your Tomato Plant</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">After you start to see the little cherry sprouts, you want to keep your eye on it to make sure it does not get too big too fast.  When you notice the stems becoming stronger and thicker, get ready to thin them out.  The tomatoes should be growing very close together, since the seeds from the tomatoes are all compacted into a small cherry tomato. YOU. DO. NOT. WANT THIS! This will only entangle the roots and shade the greens, so try to thin out the plants as early as possible.  <br><br>The maturing time is fairly long.  It can take up to 65-70 days before you start to see any sign of tomatoes.  If you decided to separately germinate the seeds, try to transfer them into the ground or a large pot when the stems are very strong and health, preferably before the fruit start to grow.  <br><br>Cherry tomatoes can come in all different shapes, colours and sizes.  Some may come in red or green or black or yellow! If you used the method mention earlier, they should come out the same colour and shape as the used tomato. <br><br>I recommend for a large pot, maybe you can fit 2 tomato plants in it.  This is because the plants grow to be very wide and bushy.  Also, it is best to have a lot of space between each stem to avoid insect infestations and to prevent diseases.  <br><br></p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Soil</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">As for the soil, the best kind to use is quality organic soil that is made for growing vegetables.  Also, this soil must be in a WELL DRAINING space.  This will help prevent any plant diseases or molding at the bottom of the pot (why I recommend a pot rather than in the ground).  This is probably the most important thing required to grow a bushy and healthy tomato plant.<br></p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Watering</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">Daily watering is required, assuming proper drainage, of course. Make sure the soil is moist at all times, as vegetables really like water so it can become very strong.  Although, depending on where you live, the amount of water may vary.<br></p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Plant Health</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">This is totally optional, but if you sprinkle a bit of compost-rich soil on-top of the surface soil, this is will give the tomatoes a very intense flavour and help the plant become stronger much faster.  I started to see a difference within a few days! <br><br>Again, this is optional, but after about 2 or 3 weeks of growth you may want to invest in some soluble balances fertilizer.  It is best to use this once a week.  Use this only until you see the fruit start to grow.  After that, you can either stop or start using a high-potassium fertilizer.   <br><br>The soil should have a moderate level of acid.  Maybe a pH level of about 6.2 - 6.5.  <br><br>Since tomatoes love moisture, they like to keep it that way.  Try not to keep it in the sun for too long.  About 4-6 hours of direct sunlight should be enough for the day.  For the rest of the day, I recommend shading it.  <br></p><img src="../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.46.41-AM.png" loading="lazy" width="667" srcset="../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.46.41-AM.png 500w, ../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.46.41-AM.png 800w, ../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.46.41-AM.png 1198w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 667px" alt=""></div>
