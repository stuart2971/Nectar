        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">About the Toxicity</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">Despite the prepossessing appearance flowers, this weed is very toxic and is known to have taken the lives of many animals and sometimes even humans.  <br>‍<br>From the roots to the flowers, everything this plant produces is toxic and anyone can get very sick from as much as touching it.  The toxicity mainly affects only mammals.  Other organisms, such such as birds, tend to eat the berries that are produced from this weed.  <br><br>This plant is highly toxic and poisionous plant, earning itself a level 2 on the toxicity scale.  When handeling this plant extra seafty precautions is strongly advised. (see below)<br><br>In many parts of the world, this plant is considered a weed and is plucked right out of the garden.  Though, the roots and seeds of this plant stays in the ground for up to 40 years.  The best way to get rid of this plant is to cut it at the base of the plant every so often.  Rooting this plant is very difficult and it may have to be done by a professional.</p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Origins</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">Pokeweeds are native to Central America, hense the name American Pokeweed.  After these plants made their way around the world, it was then used in traditional Chinese Medicine, which is partly why these plants are not illegal to grow.</p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Pokeweeds in Biomedical Research</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">Another reason for that is because recent studies, known as the Pokeweed Mitogen (PWM), researched by Yasuhiro Horii and Toshio Hhirano, have shown that this is a useful plant in immunology. The Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) have shown to prevent the HIV virus in human cells, as well as preventing laryngitis, tonsilitis, mumps and is mainly used as an anti-inflammatory drug.  <br><br>On farms, pokeweeds are popular as pest species.  Pest species are plants that are meant to attract pest, such as bugs and insect infestations, so they do not destroy the main crops.  They can also be used as ornamental flowers in a garden or on a farm.</p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Want to Eat it?</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">You may have heard of the poke sallet, notorious for its dangerous toxicity and poisonous greens.  The truth is, the sallet does contain pokeweed and can be harmful to you if it is not prepared properly.  Pokeweed MUST be cooked before eating, and must be cooked fully in order to avoid gastrointestinal pain, nausea or even the end of your life.</p><img src="../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.29.00-AM.png" loading="lazy" width="1003" srcset="../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.29.00-AM.png 500w, ../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.29.00-AM.png 800w, ../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.29.00-AM.png 1016w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 940px" alt="">
        <p class="paragraph-2">There are many recipes online to make poke sallet, though, there are many preautions that should be taken before and after the preparations.</p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Maturity</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">The best time to harvest a pokeweed, is when the berries are not fully matured.  The more mature it is, the more toxic it can be to both humans and animals.  The easiest way to tell if the plant is mature or not, is by the colour of the plant’s stem and berries.  If the stem is a bright fuchsia colour, the berries are dark purple and larger than the flowers, then chances are, the plant is fully matured.  Eating the plant in a poke sallet with the plat’s condition like this is not harmful, but stricter precautions for preparations is strongly advised.</p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Growing Tips</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">Thinking about growing your own? Here are a few tips and tricks I have picked up on when growing this plant.  <br><br>First, pokeweeds are not one for too much water.  When it is first germinating, moist soil is required, but once it matures more, watering is so much of a necessity as it can start to find water on its own.  <br><br>Like most flowers, pokeweeds bloom best in a lot of sun.  Around 6-8 hours of direct sunlight is most beneficial for these plants, with little shade every now and then.  <br><br>The best time to germinate this plant is around 3 months before summer.  When germinating, the seeds like cool dark places and seeds from the previous season’s berries can be used by placing it on a damp paper towl and placing it in an air tight baggie or container.  <br><br>In order to extract the seeds from the berries, the best method is to place the berries in water and squish them using a fork or a popsicle stick. Wait a few days and check back to see which ones are floating and which ones stayed at the bottom.  The seeds that are floating are not usable and will most likely not grow into a mature plant.  These seeds can be tossed out.  <br><br>As far as soils goes, keep it simple.  Any soil will do, but if you want to get fancy with it, you can use conpost-rich soil and sprinkle it ontop of the germinated plant.</p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Safety Precautions</strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">It is important to take the following safety measures in order to prevent several illnesses or to avoid death.  <br>1. Wear protective gloves - Pokeweeds produce a certain fluid/chemicals, known as crimson juice.  If your skin is exposed to this, it can end up absorbing the juice and entering your blood stream. <br>2. Wear protective eye wear - For obvious reasons, we do not want any part of this plant going into our eyes.  If it does, call a doctor immediately and try to rinse out the chemicals using CLEAN hands.  <br>3. Keep these plants outdoors - Although this plant can only be harmful if it enters your blood stream, the chemical fuems may not be so good for your or and pets in the house.</p>
