        <p class="paragraph-2">There are many ways to grow onions.  Personally, I like to grow onions from already matured ones.  To easily grow green onions, you can either chop off the ends of matured ones or you can buy seeds from any garden store.  Using my method, there are 2 main ways you can plant them from the ends of green onions.  <br><br>1. Submurge the chopped off roots in a cup of water.  Soon after, the shoots should start to grow.  This can be indoors or outdoors.  <br><br>2.  You can place the roots into soil.  After chopping off the roots, they can simply be placed into the ground.  <br><br>As you can see, green onions are fairly easy to grow.  Just place them in water and walk away!<br></p><img src="../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.58.07-AM.png" loading="lazy" width="514" srcset="../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.58.07-AM.png 500w, ../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.58.07-AM.png 800w, ../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.58.07-AM.png 1080w, ../images/Screen-Shot-2020-09-22-at-12.58.07-AM.png 1104w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 514px" alt="">
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Watering<br></strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">Clearly, green onions love water.  The soil should always be moist.  If need be, water your plants everyday.  Where I live, watering my plants every other day to everyday is necessary to meet the basic needs of the plant.  Again, growing green onions hydroponically is another great alternative if you are a lazy gardener or do not have any time or space outside to grow them.<br></p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Germination<br></strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">If you decide to grow these plants by seed, you should expect to wait about a month before they start to germinate.  It would not be a bad idea to germinate them 1-2 months before your season begins. <br><br>After the germination process, it should take at least one more month for your plant to fully mature.  The ideal height for the green onion shoots is about 6-8 inches.<br></p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Harvesting<br></strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">Harvesting is very easy. If you want to grow the bulb (the white part of the onion), then cut off the green leaves and but leave the root. <br><br>For the onion bulb, you should expect to wait another month or 2.  Until then, continue to the cut the green onion once they get about 6-8 inches to catch the peak flavour.  <br><br>The more you reuse this technique with the same onion, the stronger the flavour of the next batch.  This is why I strongly recommend using this technique, because it will give you a stronger taste every year!<br></p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Sun? Shade?<br></strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">Green onion grow best in full sun, meaning at least 6-8 hours a day.  They do not really like shade all too much, though if it is unavoidable where you live, it will still be able to grow.  The only problem may be that the bulbs will be a bit smaller and the entire plant will be more prone to diseases.  <br><br>Since onions like a lot of water, diseases and molding are more at risk for the plant.  Make sure that if you are growing them in soil, they must have a well-draining watering system.<br></p>
        <div class="text-block-4"><strong class="bold-text">Soil<br></strong></div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">If you decide to grow the plants in soil, be sure to use compost-rich potting soil.  The best place to plant it is somewhere very sunny and where light hits most of the day.  These plants do not like shade!!!!<br><br>Plant the onions about half an inch into the ground.  Once they have sprouted above ground, you should sprinkle grass clippings, mulch, fine pieces of bark or even sand on top of the soil.  What this does is it will absorb some of the water you use to water your onions and it will keep the soil moist for a longer period of time.  This is so that you do not have to constantly control the moisture level as often.  These toppings also help with weed control.<br><br>If growing them in a pot, these toppings are not necessary, as it is easier to control moisture levels in a smaller, confined area.  Since weeds do not grow in gardening pots, toppings are unnecessary.  If you find yourself travelling very frequently or you are just bad at taking care of plants, then maybe adding these topping will not be of harm to you!<br><br>For growing green onions, the best time to plant them is when the climate is cool, not hot or cold. Cool.  They like it cool but sunny.  This is because if the temperature were too high, then the water would evaporate too quickly and not only dry out the soil, but it will dry out the plant as well.<br></p>
